To Do

-have a log output, and maybe have a yes or no whether an error occured on a domain

- change all the print statements just to pring out the important things


-You can store less html if you only save it once per ISP for the default domain name test (in the Domain table)




Fixed
- something weird is happening where it isn't inserting the MyDNS results in to the Database - Fixed.
- currently blockpage and response code is just coming from the cloudflare results, need to get it from others as well. Need to edit my dictionary to do so. - Fixed
- There is a duplication of checking results/blockpage/response code. Fixed it by making a getter and setter of the __all_results
- gets caught on traceroute on malicious websites sometimes: e.g. http://www.anime-sharing.com/. Might just need to do a try catch to make sure it don't freeze. Maybe a timeout?
      - do a timeout on each ip on website_functions.getIPResponseCodeAndText()
- get geolocation from IP address
- get download speed for user

- collect number of script tags for every domain and include it in database
  - currently it is putting MyDNS script tags for all domains
  - I actually don't think this is an issue, because the individual IP's are collecting the right number of script tags
  - fixed by just doing a -1 to represent that there was no need to collect those script tags - DIDNT DO THIS, DECIDED AGAINST IT

- just stored the text in the MySQL

- remove Optus and AARC DNS's from DB and also the insertion of 5 domains, only needs to be 3 because AARC and Optus are being no longer put in.
- push to git, then just delete them from DNS list and see what breaks
- Might need to change the names of the sql columns so they align with the csv interpreter
- make the DNS's being checked scalable? Maybe this involves alot of deleting nonsense variables in the Domain?
- might need to do some kind of last insert to make sure there is no concurrency issues with inserting.

- need to make it such that it saves every domain as it goes. Reason being, in case it breaks or someone stops half wya through the list of domains, we stil have all the data up to that point.
  - maybe put a try catch around each domain and just go to next domain if there is an error
  - make sure no issues with getting the most recent insert in to the DB when doing the try and catch

- need to request user input for the user name,  ISP name, etc

Dismissed

- not saving MyDNS or Optus when using the uni's wifi
- might need to make an object for every IP request

-Not saving every IP address tested
  - I think this has been resolved
